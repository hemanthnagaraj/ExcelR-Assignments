Therefore, more advanced techniques like log or sqrt transformation (mean > median) can be applied to make an estimation for imputing the missing entries. However, it is worth noting that only one data entry is missing in 'Fare', so droping 0.24% of the whole dataset might not have much impact on the overall prediction. Additinally, tree-based models like XGBoost handles skewness better, hence data transformation not required."
